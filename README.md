# JoyKit
Our project offers monthly subscription boxes designed around the concept of “trying a new hobby”, targeting the age group of 10 to 24 years. Each box focuses on a specific hobby or activity—such as cooking, drawing, gardening, or group games—and includes the essential tools and materials to enjoy the activity in a fun and safe way.

A key feature of the boxes is the element of surprise: part of the content is intentionally kept mysterious, adding excitement and discovery to each experience. The project aims to encourage creativity, develop hobbies, and reduce screen time through engaging activities that can be enjoyed with friends or family.

Product Delivery & Platform
The service is provided through a dedicated mobile application and web page, integrated with fast delivery apps such as Jahez, Kita, and Mrsool. Customers can:

Choose their monthly box theme (e.g., Art Box, Cooking Box, Game Night Box)

Subscribe monthly or order on demand

Track their orders and receive them quickly, similar to food delivery services

The app also offers access to previous experiences and simple educational content about hobbies to enhance engagement.

Post-Accelerator Implementation & Expansion Plan
After the accelerator program, the focus will be on testing a minimum viable product (MVP) through:

Launching two pilot boxes (Art and Cooking) in collaboration with local supply stores.

Testing the service within schools and universities to gather feedback and improve content and packaging.

Establishing partnerships with delivery apps and local stores to expand distribution.

Upon successful pilot testing, launching monthly subscription boxes with seasonal themes (e.g., Ramadan, Summer Break, Back-to-School).

In the medium term, expanding to major cities (Riyadh, Jeddah, Eastern Province) and collaborating with local sponsors to support content within the boxes.
